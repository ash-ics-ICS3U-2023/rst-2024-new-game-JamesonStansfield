<h1>How to Play Checkers!</h1>
<br>
<body>
    <h2>The Basics:</h2>
    Checkers is a two player board game where two players battle it out using twelve pieces each to see whoever can be the last one alive.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>How to set up the board:</h3>
    To start, choose which player should go first. If this is not the first match, the person who won previously would be the first to go in the next game. The board comes it two different colours of checkers, including red, white, or black. The first player to go will choose the darker coloured checkers, like red or black, and the other player will choose white. The two players will then sit on opposite ends of the board. The bord is made of alternating squares of lught and dark. Place your checkers only in the dark spaces so that there is a light space on the right corner for each player. There should be three rows of four checkers each, and they should only be in dark squares.
    <br><br><h3>How to move your pieces:</h3>
    There are multiple rules to moving in checkers, such as: <br> Checkers can only be moved onto the black tiles. <br> At the start of the game, checkers can only be moved forward, meaning towards the opposite players side. <br> Checkers may move up and down once they make it all the way to the others players side, becoming "Kings."
